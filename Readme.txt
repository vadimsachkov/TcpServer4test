1. Overview

This is a simple multithreaded TCP server written in C++ for testing port accessibility and TCP connectivity.  
Its main purpose is to verify that a server is reachable via a specific TCP port â€” for example, to confirm proper router port forwarding, firewall configuration, or remote network access.

Clients can connect, send messages, and receive responses. The server also sends periodic time-based heartbeat messages, helping to monitor stable bidirectional communication.

Unlike ICMP ping, this server uses actual TCP connections, which makes it useful in environments where ICMP is blocked or unreliable.

2. Features

- Accepts up to 10 simultaneous TCP connections.
- Sends automatic timestamp messages every 5 seconds, if the client is idle.
- Echoes back client messages, limited to 100 characters.
- Supports clean client disconnect via "q" or the ESC key.
- Logs connection activity with client IP and port in the server console.

---

3. System Requirements

- Windows OS with Winsock (WS2_32.dll)
- MinGW (g++) or MSVC (Visual Studio) compiler
- Firewall must allow incoming connections on the selected TCP port (default: 1088)
- For external connections: ensure proper port forwarding (dst-nat) is configured on your router

4. Running the Server

Command:
    tcpserver4test.exe [port]

If no port is specified, the server defaults to port 1088.

Example:
    tcpserver4test.exe 5555

After launching, the server listens for incoming TCP connections and logs client events.

5. Connecting to the Server

Clients can use Telnet, Netcat, or custom TCP clients.

Telnet:
    telnet SERVER_IP 1088

Replace SERVER_IP with the actual IP address of the server.

Netcat (for local testing):
    nc 127.0.0.1 1088

6. Commands and Server Interaction

Client Input              | Server Response
--------------------------|-------------------------------
q + Enter                 | Closes the connection
ESC (ASCII 27)            | Immediately disconnects
Text + Enter              | Server replies with "Received: <your text>"
> 100 chars               | Input truncated to 100 characters
(no input, idle)          | Every 5 seconds, server sends a line:
                          | `<n> #<conn_id> <IP>:<port> - <timestamp>`

Example:
    3 #2 192.168.1.10:52918 - 2025-03-28 15:40:10

7. Stopping the Server

To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the console or close the terminal window.

---

8. Compilation Instructions

MinGW (g++):

    g++ -o tcpserver.exe tcpserver4test.cpp -lws2_32 -std=c++11

MSVC (Visual Studio):

    cl /EHsc tcpserver4test.cpp ws2_32.lib

The compiled binary `tcpserver.exe` can then be launched from the command line.

---

9. Use Cases

- Testing if a port is open and reachable from a remote network
- Verifying NAT and port forwarding rules
- Diagnosing firewalls or ISP-level restrictions
- Monitoring TCP availability when ICMP ping is blocked
- Lightweight heartbeat mechanism for TCP health checking
